# Canopy IIIF (Work in Progress)

[![Deploy to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/canopy-iiif/app/actions/workflows/deploy-pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/canopy-iiif/app/actions/workflows/deploy-pages.yml)

Static site generator powered by MDX and IIIF. The stable app entry at `app/scripts/canopy-build.mjs` orchestrates UI assets and calls the library to build from `content/` into `site/`.

## Quick Start

- Install: `npm install`
- Develop: `npm run dev` (serves `http://localhost:3000`)
- Build: `npm run build`

Entrypoint details

- Both commands run `node app/scripts/canopy-build.mjs`.
- Dev mode starts the UI watcher (`@canopy-iiif/ui`) and the dev server from `@canopy-iiif/lib`.
- Build mode builds the UI once, then runs the site build from `@canopy-iiif/lib`.

## Content Tree

```
content/
  _layout.mdx          # optional: site-wide layout wrapper
  _styles.css          # optional: site-wide CSS copied to site/styles.css
  index.mdx            # homepage → site/index.html
  sitemap.mdx          # sitemap page (receives props.pages) → site/sitemap.html
  docs/
    getting-started.mdx
    guide.mdx
  works/
    _layout.mdx        # layout for IIIF manifests (receives props.manifest)
```

Build output goes to `site/`. Development cache lives in `.cache/`:

- `.cache/mdx`: transient compiled MDX modules used to render MDX/JSX.
- `.cache/iiif`: IIIF cache used by the builder:
  - `index.json`: primary index storing `byId` (Collection/Manifest ids to slugs) and `collection` metadata (uri, hash, updatedAt).
  - `manifests/{slug}.json`: cached, normalized Manifest JSON per work page.
  - Legacy files like `manifest-index.json` may be removed as part of migrations.
  - Clear this cache by deleting `.cache/iiif/` if you need a fresh fetch.

## Assets

Place static files under `assets/` and they will be copied to the site root, preserving subpaths. For example:

- `assets/images/example.jpg` → `site/images/example.jpg`
- `assets/downloads/file.pdf` → `site/downloads/file.pdf`

## Development

- Run `npm run dev` to start a local server at `http://localhost:3000` with live reload.
- Editing MDX under `content/` triggers a site rebuild and automatic browser reload.
- Editing files under `assets/` copies only the changed files into `site/` (no full rebuild) and reloads the browser.

## IIIF Build

- Layout: add `content/works/_layout.mdx` to enable IIIF work page generation. The layout receives `props.manifest` (normalized to Presentation 3).
- Source: collection URI comes from `canopy.yml` (`collection.uri`) or `CANOPY_COLLECTION_URI` env var.
- Behavior:
  - Recursively walks the collection and subcollections, fetching Manifests.
  - Normalizes resources using `@iiif/helpers` to v3 where possible.
  - Caches fetched Manifests in `.cache/iiif/manifests/` and tracks ids/slugs in `.cache/iiif/index.json`.
  - Emits one HTML page per Manifest under `site/works/<slug>.html`.
- Performance: tune with `iiif.chunkSize` and `iiif.concurrency` in `canopy.yml` or via env `CANOPY_CHUNK_SIZE` and `CANOPY_FETCH_CONCURRENCY`.
- Cache notes: switching `collection.uri` resets the manifest cache; you can also delete `.cache/iiif/` to force a refetch.

### Thumbnails

- Config keys (in `canopy.yml` under `iiif.thumbnails`):
  - `unsafe` (boolean, default `false`): when `true`, uses an expanded strategy that may perform extra requests to find a representative image.
  - `preferredSize` (number, default `1200`): target width/height in pixels when selecting a thumbnail.
- Behavior: during the IIIF build, a thumbnail URL is resolved for each Manifest and stored on its entry in `.cache/iiif/index.json` as `thumbnail`.
- Safety: with `unsafe: false`, a simpler/safer selection is used; with `unsafe: true`, the helper may probe additional sources to find a better image at the requested size.
- Current project setting: `preferredSize: 400`.

## Interactive Components (SSR + Hydration)

Two interactive areas are available out of the box and render safely in MDX:

- Viewer: `<Viewer iiifContent="…" />` — wraps `@samvera/clover-iiif` and hydrates client‑side.
- Search (composable): place any of these where you want on the page and they hydrate client‑side:
  - `<SearchForm />` — input + type select
  - `<SearchSummary />` — summary text (query/type aware)
  - `<SearchResults />` — results list
  - `<SearchTotal />` — live count of shown results

How it works:

- MDX is rendered on the server. Browser‑only components emit a lightweight placeholder element.
- The build injects `site/scripts/react-globals.js` and the relevant hydration script(s) into pages that need them.
- On load, the hydration script finds placeholders, reads props (embedded as JSON), and mounts the React component.

Usage examples:

```
// content/index.mdx
## Demo
<Viewer iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/…?as=iiif" />

// content/search/_layout.mdx
# Search
<SearchForm />
<SearchSummary />
<SearchResults />
<div className="sr-only">Total: <SearchTotal /></div>
```

Notes:

- You do not need to import components in MDX; they are auto‑provided by the MDX provider from `@canopy-iiif/ui`.
- The Viewer and Search placeholders render minimal HTML on the server and hydrate in the browser.
- The search runtime (`site/search.js`) uses FlexSearch and supports filtering by `type` (e.g., `work`, `page`, `docs`). The four subcomponents share a single client store so they stay in sync.

Advanced layout (optional, future):

- If you need full control over the search page layout, we'll expose a composable Search API (slots or render props) so you can place the form, summary, and results anywhere. Until then, `<Search />` renders a sensible default.

Dot‑notation (future): we may also expose these as `<Search.Form />`, `<Search.Results />`, `<Search.Summary />`, `<Search.Total />` if needed.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` builds `site/` and deploys to Pages.
- Enable Pages: in repository Settings → Pages → set Source to "GitHub Actions" (or use the workflow’s automatic enablement if allowed).
- Trigger: pushes to `main` (or run manually via Actions → "Deploy to GitHub Pages").
- Output: the workflow uploads the `site/` folder as the Pages artifact and deploys it.

<!-- PAGES_URL_END -->

- CI tuning (optional):
  - `canopy.yml` → `iiif.chunkSize`, `iiif.concurrency` to control fetch/build parallelism.
  - Env overrides (in workflow): `CANOPY_CHUNK_SIZE`, `CANOPY_FETCH_CONCURRENCY`, and `CANOPY_COLLECTION_URI` (use a small collection for faster CI).
- Project Pages base path: links currently use absolute `/…`. If deploying under `/<repo>` you may want base‑path aware links; open an issue if you want this wired in.

## Template Workflow

- This repository (`app`) maintains a separate template repository (`template`).
- On push to `main`, `.github/workflows/release-and-template.yml` publishes packages and, when a publish occurs, builds a clean template and force‑pushes it to `canopy-iiif/template` (branch `main`).
- The workflow:
  - Excludes dev‑only paths (`.git`, `node_modules`, `packages`, `.cache`, `.changeset`, internal workflows/docs).
  - Rewrites `package.json` to remove workspaces and depend on published `@canopy-iiif/lib`/`@canopy-iiif/ui` versions; sets `build`/`dev` scripts to run `node app/scripts/canopy-build.mjs`.
  - Patches the template’s deploy workflow to include an inline “verify HTML generated” step.
- Setup:
  - Create the `template` repo under the `canopy-iiif` org (or your chosen owner) and add a `TEMPLATE_PUSH_TOKEN` secret (PAT with repo write access) to this repo’s secrets.
  - Optionally mark `template` as a Template repository so users can click “Use this template”.
